### Where I Am

I'm a husband and a father. I'm finishing up my masters at the Royal College of Art. I'll be graduating in a couple of weeks, just in time for a career change! While art has helped shape me, programming and the web have beguiled me. I'm currently searching for a programming job and am willing to relocate. If you're looking to hire, get in touch!
